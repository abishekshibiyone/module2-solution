                    <div id="head1">Aventador</div>
                <div class="row1"><p>This is the LB834 … new better known as the Aventador, the latest and bravest from Sant’Agata, and again this is a true Raging Bull straight from the breeding grounds in Italy. This new flagship will succeed the Murciélago, and because of the sometimes difficult to pronounce name Automobili Lamborghini SpA went for a more straight forward naming this time.</p></div>

                    <div id="head2">Huracan</div>
                <div class="row2"><p>The Minotauro aerodynamic kit from Duke Design for the Huracán keeps a rather low profile look when it comes to spoilers and wings … in fact there isn’t even a rear wing in this kit at the moment, instead we can admire a very nicely styled front lower bumper that combines elegance with a flair of aggressiveness, especially as it does extend forward up front … and upward on the sides.</p></div>

                    <div id="head3">Urus</div>
                <div class="row3"><p>The Lamborghini Urus might be considered to be a successor to the LM002 from the Eighties, but this is a totally different type of vehicle, the LM002 was a pure bred off road car initially developed for military use, the Urus on the other hand has been conceived with one purpose in mind: a high end, ultra luxurious and stupendously fast super car dressed in an Italian design SUV suit.</p></div>
